# Travis does shallow clones with depth = 50, older git versions do not
# allow making clones from a shallow remote.
# Github must be deployed with strategy git, because default strategy anvil
# does not suppert custom buildpacks. Heroku, however, seems to use an
# older Version of git, since it cannot clone from the shallow repo on
# travis. Therefore, deployment is done manually.
